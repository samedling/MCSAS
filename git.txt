If you've never used git before, you may find this helpful.

Setup:
Make sure you have git and a github account.
E-mail scott.medling@anu.edu.au with your username so I can add you as a collaborator.

To configure your local git, run
    git config --global user.name "<Name>"
    git config --global user.email "<E-mail Address>"
    git config --global color.ui auto       #Improves readability.
    git config --global core.editor vim     #If you like.

To download the respository, run
    git clone https://github.com/samedling/MCSAS.git


Basic Git Use (do every time you edit):
`git pull origin master`    #Download latest changes.  Run this every time you start.

After editing a file, or number of files
`git add <filename>`        #Adds a filename
`git add <filename2>`       #Adds another filename, etc.

`git status`                #Tells you which files have been changed and/or added.

`git commit -m "<Insert a short message about what you did here.>"  #Saves added changes locally.
`git push -u origin master` #Uploads changes to respository.


Other Useful Git Commands:
`git log --oneline`     #Displays summary of each commit.
`git log -<n>`          #Displays last n commit details.
`git log --after="<yyyy-mm-dd>"`


Advanced Git Use:
If there's a collision/conflict/whatever (usually at the push stage) because you and someone both editing the same part of the same file, you'll need to manually fix it, which sometimes sucks.  You may need to separately run `git fetch` and `git merge`.

If you want to go back just to look, make sure you've committed any changes and then run `git checkout <hex_number>`

To create a new branch so you can make commits based on an older version (again, make sure you've committed any changes), run `git checkout -b <branch_name> <hex_number>`
