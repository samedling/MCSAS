## Editing the Develop Branch ##

Definitely use the develop branch for any potentially unstable changes.  Do not edit the master branch directly if you have potentially unstable changes.
It's recommended you use this for minor stuff also, in order to keep it up-to-date.

`git checkout develop`     #Switch to develop branch.
`git pull origin develop`  #Download latest changes to develop branch.  Run this every time.

Make your changes.

`git status`                  #Tells you which files have been changed.
`git diff <filename>`         #Displays diff (since last add or commit) for single modified file.
`git add <filename>`          #Adds a filename
`git add <filename2>`         #Adds another filename, etc.
`git status`                  #Tells you which files have been changed and/or added.

`git diff --cached`           #Displays diff between current state and last commit.
`git commit -m "<Insert a short message about what you did here.>"  #Saves added changes locally.
`git push -u origin develop`  #Uploads changes to respository.

At this point you can put easily pause, just remember to start from the beginning (with `git checkout develop`).
Repeat this process until you are ready to send your changes to the master branch (the branch other people use).
Make sure you have edited newgui.py lines 2 & 3 to update the date and version number manually.

`git checkout master`             #Switch to master branch.
`git branch`                      #Verify on master branch.
`git pull origin master`          #Update master branch.
`git merge develop --no-ff`       #Merge while preserving commit history
`git push --all`                  #Upload all branches.
