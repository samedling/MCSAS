Recently Done (commit message):

To Do:

## High Priority ##

Add basic comments to the top of each file.
Debug additional OpenCL shapes.
Debug update_interval.
Move fitting code to fit.py.

## Medium Priority ##

Move other functions (sequence,make_intensity, etc.) somewhere??
Rename newgui.py to mcsas.py or gui.py or something.

Better downsampling & cropping of exp_data (only crop once).
Create test cases (which should also be timed).
Comment & clean up code.
Implement scale parameter.
Add Abort button.
Don't overwrite filenames.

## Low Priority ##

Enable horizontal multiplot GUI flag
Add separate filenames for fit_results.
Difference plot should always be linear (not log)?
Add initial messages to fitlog (geometry,cropping,downsampling)
Choose dictionary file to load from?
Better to calculate residuals from already run calculations.
Save and load from files?
Enable specifying random seed?
Preconditioning:
   radius of curvature depends on angle
Add ability to change sampling frequency (pixel distance) as a function of position even for non-experimental data.
Check parameters list for duplicates
Do not run Fit if exp_data center is "0 0", or at least do something intelligent.
Add additional variables used by Points_For_Calculation: ave_dist, z_scale?
Add ability to set number of cores:
    `use omp_lib` in each subroutine + `call OMP_SET_NUM_THREADS(n)`


Bounds for variables (specifically rho <1000, maybe radius < 50nm).
   Easy option: add test in residuals; if parameter too far outside range, reset it to it's original value and fit without it, then allow it to vary again?
   Hard option: implement a method down below
